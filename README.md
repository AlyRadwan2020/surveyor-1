# RapidPro Surveyor
RapidPro ushered in a new era of flow-based SMS interaction. Flows have now allowed project managers to easily implement SMS or Voice based applications with simple drag-and-drop mechanics. To further the reach of this innovative approach, a new Android application called Surveyor that can run RapidPro Flows in an offline context and submit them at a later time when a connection is available was created.

### Is this like ODK?
This approach is particularly useful for running surveys in person with enumerators in much the same way ODK was intended for. Where Surveyor differs is that it leverages the power of the RapidPro platform. It's far easier designing your survey and skip logic using RapidPro's flow builder. ODK currently offers more data types, however these along with a much richer client-side experience are coming soon to Surveyor.
